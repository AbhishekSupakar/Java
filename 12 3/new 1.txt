Types of method:
    5 based on different categories:
      1. based on declaration:
          Predefined Method:
         The methods which are already defined in predefined classes
         or interfaces inside predefined packages to perform some
         complex tasks are called as predefined method.
         Predefined Classes:
          Object
            Math

        Number
        Byte
        Short
        Integer
        Long
        Float
        Double
        Character
        Boolean

        Arrays

        String
        StringBuilder
        StringBuffer

        ArrayList
        LinkedList
        Vector
        Stack

        HashSet
        LinkedHashSet
        TreeSet

        PriorityQueue.....

        Predefined Interface:
           Iterable
           Iterator
           CloseAble
           Collection
           List
           Set
           Queue
           Map .....

taking input from user during execution of program:
    - using Scanner
    - using command line argument
Scanner:
 - Scanner is a predefined class.
 - Scanner is available inside 'util' package.
 - util is available inside API 'java'.
 - As Scanner class is not available in 'java.lang'  hence we must import.
 - Scanner class contains predefined non static methods which will be called
   by programmer to allow the user to enter value.
     public byte nextByte()  -- for accepting byte value from user
     public short nextShort() -- for accepting short value from user
     public int nextInt()   -- for accepting int value from user
     public long nextLong()  -- for accepting long value from user

     public float nextFloat() -- for accepting float value from user
     public double nextDouble() -- for accepting double value from user

     public boolean nextBoolean() - for accepting boolean value form user
     
     public char next().charAt(0) - for accepting single character from user

     public String next():  for accepting string without space from user
     public String nextLine(): for accepting whitespace character in string from user


  class Sample{
  public void display(){
  System.out.println("hello how are you");
  }
  public static void main(String []args){
   Sample s1 = new Sample();
   s1.display();//called directly in same class
  }
  }

  class Example{
  public static void main(String []args){
     Sample s1 = new Sample();
     s1.display();// SM called from another class using class name.
  }
  }

class AngelPriya{
  int age;
public int getAge(){
    System.out.println("Hi");
  return age;
}
public static void main(String []args){
System.out.println("bakra trapped in angel priya's walk");
  AngelPriya a1 = new AngelPriya();
  a1.age = 16;
  //calling a method which is returning value
 int result =  a1.getAge();
 System.out.println(result);
System.out.println("bakra dead");
}
}

//WAP to store a number and display it
import java.util.Scanner;
class Test01{
public static void main(String []args){
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.println("Enter a number: ");
int x = sc.nextInt();// used to accept number(int type) from user through keyboard
System.out.println("The value entered: "+x);
}
