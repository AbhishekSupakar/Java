Q1. Write a program that performs various arithmetic operations
(addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus) on
int, float, and double types. Observe any differences in results
or precision between them.

Q2. Write a program that takes two integers and two double values.
Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus
operations on both sets of values and print the results.
Objective: Practice arithmetic operations on int and double types
and observe how division differs between integer and floating-point numbers.

Q3. Create local variables for two integers, num1 and num2.
Assign them values and perform addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division, and modulus operations. Print the results.

Q4. Declare local variables of different types (int, double, char, and boolean).
Assign compatible values and print each variable.

Q5.  Define a local variable for the radius of a circle, then calculate, store and
print the area of circle using the formula area = Ï€ * radius * radius.

Q6. Define a variable for temperature in Celsius, convert it to Fahrenheit using
the formula fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32, and print the result.

Q7. Declare and initialize two String variables. Concatenate them into
a single message, store and print the result.(Hint: + used with strings cab be used
to concatenate)

Q8. Define three int variables for three numbers, calculate their average, and print it.

Q9. Write a program that swaps the values of two integer variables without using a
    third variable.

Q10.  Create a program that stores a length in meters as a double and converts
      it to kilometers.
