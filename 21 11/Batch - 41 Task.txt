Q1. Write a Java program to display all the Buzz Numbers between two integers
p and q (where p < q). A Buzz Number is a number that either:
   - Ends with 7 (last digit is 7), or
   - Is divisible by 7.
Requirements:
Create a user-defined method named isBuzzNumber(int num) to check if
a number is a Buzz Number.
The method should return true if the number is a Buzz Number, otherwise
return false.
Create another method named displayBuzzNumbers(int p, int q) to iterate
through the range [p, q] and display all the Buzz Numbers.
In the main() method:
Store value for input for p and q.
Call the method displayBuzzNumbers(p, q) to display the results.
Example Input and Output:
Input:
int p = 10
int q = 30

Output:
The Buzz Numbers between 10 and 30 are:
14, 17, 21, 27

Q2. WAP for following requirement:
Store an integer number and a choice number and perform the task as follows:
If choice is 1:
call 'isPalindrome(int num)':Check and display the number is a
palindrome number or not a Palindrome.

If choice is 2: call 'isPerfect(int num)':Check if the number is a
Perfect Number or not a perfect number.

If no choice matches then display "Exit."

Input and Output Example:
Input:  choice: 1
         number: 151
Output: 151 is a Palindrome Number.

Input: choice: 2
       number: 28
Output: 28 is a Perfect Number.

Input: choice: 3
Output: Exit.

Q3. Write a Java program to store a number and determine the following
using user-defined methods:
Count the number of digits in the number.
Check whether the number contains an odd or even number of digits.
Requirements:
Create a user-defined method named countDigits(int number):
Accept an integer as input.
Store total count of digits in the number in a variable 'count'.
Call another user-defined method named isOdd(int count) from same method:Accept
the count of digits as input.
Display whether the count is odd, or even.

Example Input and Output:
Sample Input:
number: 749

Sample Output:
Number of digits = 3
The number contains an odd number of digits.
