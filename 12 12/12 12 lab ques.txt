Question - 1
--------------
Design sports Model system

Create  a class name Sports (BLC Class) with private attribute sportsname, teamSize, sportType.
Take a no parameterize constructor and initialize all the default values to variables.
Take one more constructor with two parameters sportName and teamSize and initialize with user values based on validation.
Take another constructor with 3 parameters and initialize all the values based on proper validation.
Create a displayInfo() method to print all the details of the class.


Take a Main Class(ELC Class) which having main method and instantiate the object and execute the method.
Test Cases to follow:
for teamSize, If teamSize is less than or equal to zero, it sets teamSize to 0 and prints an error message.

Test Case 1: Object creation with name and team size
---------------

Expected Output :
---------------------
Sport Name: Football
Team Size: 11
Sport Type: Unknown


Test Case 2: Object creation with valid sport with negative team size
Expected Output :
---------------------
Error: Team size must be positive.

Sport Name: Cricket
Team Size: 0
Sport Type: Unknown

Test Case 3: Object creation with valid sport, team size and Sport type.
Expected Output :
---------------------
Sport Name: Football
Team Size:11
Sport Type: Outdoor


Question -2
---------------
A class called  Time is given to you. The task is to create and return a new time object in terms of hours, minutes and seconds by adding two Time objects.

Define the following for the class.
Attributes :
hours ,minutes ,seconds as private  :-for all (int) is data type and (private) is the access modifier.

Constructor :
Create a no-parameterize constructor. Initialize all attributes to 0.
Create a public parameterized constructor for hours, minutes.
Create a public parameterized constructor for hours, minutes and seconds in the same sequence.

Methods :
       Create setter and getter methods for each attribute.

    Name of the method : show()
    Return Type        : void
    Modifier       : public
    Task            : It must display the time in hours: minutes: seconds format.

       Name Of the method : add(Time t1, Time t2)
    Return Type     : Time
    Modifiers:    : public, static
    Arguments    : 2 Time class as arguments.
    Task        : Add the time And displays the added times.


Take a ELC Class TimeTester class having main method instatiate the object and check the test cases.


Example :
Sample Input :
time 1 : 2:30:40
time 2 : 4:40:21

Expected output :
Result : 7:11:1


Example :
Sample Input :
time 1 : 2:30
time 2 : 4:40

Expected Output:
 Result : 7:10:0
