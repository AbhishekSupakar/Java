----------------   Execution Process of JVM   -------------
                    (Introduction to JVM Architecture)
- Whenever JVM has to execute a java program it calls three main
   resources:
       - Class Loader
       - main method
       - Garbage Collector
- Whenever execution has to start JVM takes some memory from RAM.
  The memory is divided into 5 different categories:
    1. method area:class is loaded
    2. stack area: execution is done
    3. heap area:divided into two parts:
                 1. Static Pool Area
                 *all the static elements
         2. Heap Memory
               *object is loaded
            inside object all the non static elements are loaded
    4. PC register: here execution records are maintained
    5. JNI: all the native methods are loaded.

- Class loader responsibility is to load the class.It also loads all
  the SV and SM into a special memory area named as Static Pool Area.
- Once the loading is done, class loader will exit and JVM will call
  main method so that the excecution of the program will be done
  line by line.
- Once the execution is done, JVM calls the last resource to clean the
  memory. The resources is Garbage Collector.
