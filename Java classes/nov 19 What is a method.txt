---------------- Method and Types of Method ----------------
Method:
- A method is a part of program which contains a block in which we provide
  business logic to perform some business operations.
- A method has following parts:
    access modifier: where to access
    non acess modifier: how to access
    return type: tell about the type of value to be returned
    method name: identification of method
    method paranthesis: separator to hold input for operation in parameters
    method parameters: variables to get the input during method call
    throws statement: report the exception to a caller
    method body: curly braces inside which we write logic to be reused
    method logic: statements to be exceuted as the operation
    semicolon: end of statement
    e.g:
     public static void findSum(int a, int b)

 Terms in method:
    method prototype/ header: complete declaration which contains
        modifiers , return type, method name and parameters
   
    method signature: combination of return type and method name alongwith
     parameters.

Note: In a method only the signature is compulsory, the remaining are dependent
      on requirement.

There are 5 types of methods based on different factors:
    1. based on declaration
         i. Predefined
     ii. User Defined

    2. based on accessibility:
         i. static method
     ii. non static method

    3. based on input:
        i. parameterized method
    ii. non parameterized method

    4. based on output:
       i,. method with void as return type
       ii. method with data type as return type

    5. based on body
      i.  concrete method
      ii. abstract method
