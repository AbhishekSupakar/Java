Users can withdraw money through one of the following methods:

Cash Withdrawal:

Modifier : public
Return type: void
Method  name and parameters: withdraw(double amount)

Provide the amount as a double. This method will check if sufficient balance is available before withdrawal, if not then it prints "Insufficient balance. Withdrawal denied."
If sufficient balance is there then this method updates the balance by reducing the given amount from it and prints a message
"Withdrawal of  <amount >  successful. Remaining balance:  <balance>. "


Cheque Withdrawal:
---------------------------------
Modifier : public
Return type: void
Method  name and parameters: withdraw(String chequeNumber, double amount)
Logic :
Recieves a valid cheque number as a String. The system verifies the cheque before proceeding.
This methods checks that the chequeNumber stats with "CHK" or not . If yes then it prints
 "Cheque withdrawal with cheque number <chequeNumber> processed successfully.
 "Withdrawal of <amount> successful.  Remaining balance:  <balance>."

 , if not then it prints "Invalid cheque number. Withdrawal denied.".

ATM Card Withdrawal:
-----------------------------------
Modifier : public
Return type: void
Method  name and parameters: withdraw(long atmNumber, double amount)
Logic :
Receives the ATM card number as a long. The system ensures that the card is valid before processing.
The method validates given ATM card numbers, by ensuring that the ATM number contains exact 16 digits.
If yes then it performs the withdrawal operation by validating the sufficient amount.
If the atmNumber contains 16 digits and also the balance is sufficient then it prints
"ATM card withdrawal processed successfully."
 "Withdrawal of <amount> successful.  Remaining balance:  <balance>."
If the atmNumber not contains 16 digits then it prints
"Invalid card number. Withdrawal denied."
